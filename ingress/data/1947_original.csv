The aircraft crashed landed but there were no fatalities. An almost identical accident with the same cause occurred on 10/24/47. The flight crew transferred fuel either intentionally or inadvertently from the No. 4 alternate tanks to the No. 3 alternate tanks and failed to stop the transfer process in time to avoid overflowing the No. 3 alternate tank. Gasoline flowed through the No. 3 alternate vent line, out the vent, and was carried back by the slipstream, entering the cabin heater combustion air intake scoop. When the cabin heater came on, an explosion and fire occurred. Caused by a design flaw in the aircraft design which allowed vented fuel to be suck into the fresh air inlet."
