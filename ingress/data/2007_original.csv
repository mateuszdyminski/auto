Wreckage was found 5 miles south of Parepare. The accident was caused by the autopilot being accidentally disconnected. The two pilots had been trying to fix a problem with the plane's navigation instruments when they disconnected the autopilot and lost control of the plane. Without the autopilot, the plane went out of control, listing to the right and pitching down. The IRS navigation system was repeatedly reported malfunctioning but was never repaired. This is what initially distracted the crew."

The plane had an emergency on board and was trying to return to the airport. Both the pilot and copilot were killed. The pilot's failure to maintain an adequate airspeed during the initial climb resulting in an inadvertent stall/spin. Contributing to the accident were the second pilots inadequate preflight, failure to properly secure the front baggage door, and the front left baggage door opening in flight, which likely distracted the first pilot."

The left wing hit the ground and separated from the fuselage. The plane then rolled over inverted and the fuselage broke apart. The accident can be blamed on both the controller, who did not inform the pilot about the reduced visibility in time due to organizational problems, and on the pilot, who did not give the dispatcher the correct information about his landing trajectory and, consequently, did not decide to stop the landing procedure and try to take another approach at the time he should have done so."

The plane was just six months old. After take off, the plane was banking right and the pilot did not notice the inclination, but when he did, he banked the craft further right. The pilot released the flight controls for nearly one minute without engaging the auto pilot, which could have corrected the banking angle, then at 34 degrees. However, his intervention worsened the tilt. The captain grabed the controls, appeared confused about the attitude of the airplane and made corrections in an erratic manner increasing the banking angle to 50 degrees.

The plane skidded off the end of the runway across a major roadway and struck a gas station and building, bursting into flames. The right engine had a malfunctioning reverser. In this situation, the correct procedure was for the pilot to retard both throttles to idle and then advance both throttles to reverse, as if he had no problem with the reversers. The former procedure, which was changed by Airbus, was to take both throttles to idle, and then advance just the throttle corresponding to the engine with the operating reverser. It was changed by Airbus because there had been several incidents where the pilot forgot to bring both throttles back to idle, leaving one engine reversed and the other thrusting forward. The downside to this change was it would lengthen the stopping distance. The pilot was so concerned about the short and slippery runway that he chose to switch to the old procedure and got it wrong. A contributing factor was the heavy rain and wind and the fact that the newly resurfaced runway had not had grooves installed yet."
