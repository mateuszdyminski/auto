One of the survivors said a baggage area door opened at the nose of the plane on the pilot’s side that prompted the pilot to try to return to the airport. Failure of company maintenance personnel to ensure that the airplane's nose baggage door latching mechanism was properly configured and maintained, resulting in an inadvertent opening of the nose baggage door in flight. Contributing to the accident were the lack of information and guidance available to the operator and pilot regarding procedures to follow should a baggage door open in flight and an inadvertent aerodynamic stall."

An investigation showned that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted; most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system. The ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel, and should have been melted by the fuel-oil heat exchanger (FOHE). However, the FOHE did not heat its own inlet face, and investigation showed that, although the flight was within the certified operational envelope at all times, a long period of low fuel flow in an unusually cold environment, followed by a throttle increase, could cause an ice jam at that point. Corrections in design were made so this would not occur again."

One person survived the accident but died later. The pilots were both working on insufficient sleep and displayed poor coordination with one another. The pilots failed to account for a wet runway and 8-knot tailwind when they touched down on the 5,500-foot runway, and they should have applied a braking system a full seven seconds earlier than they did.Realizing they were running out of runway, the pilots hit the throttles to try to take off again. Had the pilots hit the lift dump right after touchdown, or landed into the wind, the plane probably could have stopped safely on the runway. The accident was due to the captain's decision to attempt a go-around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident were the pilots' poor crew coordination and lack of cockpit discipline.; fatigue, which likely impaired both pilots' performance and failure of the FAA to require crew resource management training and standard operating procedures for Part 135 operators."

While cruising at this altitude, the aircraft was caught in a violent gust that initially pushed the plane upwards and towards the mountain. As the pilot tried to steer the aircraft away from the mountain, he realized that the airspeed had decayed to 40 kts., indicating an imminent stall. He decided to dive in order to gain air speed. As he did so the VSI indicated a rate of sink of 2,000 feet per minute while the airspeed remained at 40 kts. Visibility was poor and the pilot did not see the ground till impact at 14,399 feet. Four Italian tourists were killed. Only the pilot survived. It is therefore very likely that the aircraft was caught in a mountain wave that caused the sudden altitude gain and the subsequent stall."

The aircraft soon after crashed into the sea and broke up. While attempting to test slowing the airplane to an unsafe speed, the plane's computer failed to automatically recover to safe flight, The plane stalled and crashed.
